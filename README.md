# RL-IndividualAssignment
The goal of this assignment is to apply reinforcement learning techniques to the Text Flappy Bird (TFB)
game. TFB is a simplified version of the popular Flappy Bird game, featuring a single-element character.
Within the scope of this assignment, two agents, namely a Monte Carlo-based agent and a Sarsa agent
have been implemented. The comparison is made using the state value function.
